        <h1>How Did I Do It You Might Ask...</h1>
        <p>Well to be honest I'm not quite sure. I feel like it was mostly dumb luck and a lot of trial and error. Refreshing the page a million times to see if it worked.
        Maybe that's the secret, from now on try to do something right after seeing it, so it sticks.
        The biggest trick is to google it. Just don't get lost in all the variations. Lots of information that helps but a lot more that's just a rabbit hole.
